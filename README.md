# TEMPERATURE & HUMIDITY #

# Temperature and Humidity Sensor (DHT11 / DHT22)

  The code to understand the DHT sensor and how it works.
  Using the LED as an output in presence of heat which is temperature in degree Celcius.

  Connect to the Adafruit MQTT.
  Making the project become a Internet of Things.
  The MQTT can monitor and record the temperature and humidity from DHT11 / DHT22 sensor.
